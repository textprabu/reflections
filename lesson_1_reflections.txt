How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    if we found what is the difference or what change is made 
    we could identity the outcome or what altering our desired outcome.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
  pros : can keep track of chages made at given time.
  cons : manual entering of commits . may forget to commit.
    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    it is easier to understand when and why a code changed in all the files saved in a commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log list the commit in order of time and date .
    git diff enables to find differences in two versions of the same file by comparing the commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
since we are able to check and retrieve what change is done in program code by means of commit , confidently changes can be made without the fear of beaking some codes.subl subl
